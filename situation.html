	  <p>
        Our Earth is in desperate need of our help! We need to save our home, our
        only planet for all the people around us! We are killing our planet, but
		some reach out to help our beloved Earth. Reach out, too! Now let me show
		why we must take care of our Earth:
      </p>

	     All of our trash goes into the ocean and washes up somewhere. Turtles
       mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and get straws sucked up there noses
       which suffucates them. Some of our trash stays on land! In India, cows on
        the streets eat the trash and then produce toxic milk instead of the sweet
        milk we know. Even birds are having problems with trash. These are not
        the only animals having these problems. If this keeps up, turtles, cows,
         birds and other animals may be extinct!
	  </p>

	     Not just animals are suffering, but our planet too. Our beautiful planet
       Earth is turning into a dump. Trash covers our beaches, oceans, and cities.
       The Great Pacific Garbage Patch weighs 7 million tons, is twice the size
       of Texas, and is up to 9 feet deep. That's a lot of garbage!

	     But it's not just trash that is hurting our planet, there is pollution
       too! Air pollution  from cars and factories and water pollution from oil
       spills and more.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	     All of the pollution has been effecting animals. These poor otters and
       birds get covered in oil when an oil spills occur. Many other animals also
       suffer from pollution. But is it just animals? People in China, India, and
		   many other countries have to wear masks or suffer from asthma/lung disease.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		 These are not the only ways humans have harmed and polluted our planet.
     Cutting down trees hurts animal habitats. Pollution makes lasting mistakes
     that hurts our ecosystems. Animals and people all over the world suffer from
	   our mistakes. This must end! Whatever you can do to help; from planting a
     tree to making a law; help our planet! Clean our only home! Clean it so our
     future generations can breathe clean air, see animals in nature, but above
     all; live a healthy life on earth, <u>this</u> earth, our only <em>Home</em>!
