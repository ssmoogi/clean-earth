      <p>
        Now I know what might be going through your head, right about now: "What
        should I do?" "Where should I start??" "Should I head on over to the beach and
        start picking up trash?" "Should I raise an organization that picks up trash
        anytime they see something?" You could if you wanted to, but where you should
        start is yourself. Let me give you an example:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are out for a walk and you have a candy with you. You peel the wrapper
        off, and pop the candy into your mouth. You look around and see that there is
        not a trash can in site. What are you going to do? Are you going to hold onto
        the wrapper and throw it out once you see a trashcan? Or are you going to
        make sure that no one is looking and then drop it onto the sidewalk?
        Now what is bad about that? You have just contributed, to the problem.
        Now you should do it the first way, and you will have stopped a peice of
        trash from harming someone or something. Now here is a list of what you
        can and should do to keep our beloved Earth healthy and beautiful:
      </p>
      <ul class="solution-list">
        <li>Throw rotten fruit into a compost bin, or into your garden.</li>
        <li>If you see trash, make sure to throw it away.</li>
        <li>
          If you have to go somewhere, try riding your bike, or walking to your
          destination instead of always driving (or being driven).
        </li>
        <li>
          If you can't ride or bike, carpool with your friends, if they are going
          to the same place.
         </li>
        <li>Do not use the lights or technology a lot, turn it off whenever you can.</li>
        <li>Carry a cloth bag and a reusable water bottle, where ever you go.</li>
        <li>
          If a Redwood tree is cut down, don't plant a Pine tree or an Oak tree,
          but plant a Redwood tree. Replace what you took!
         </li>
         <li>Here are a few facts about trees:</li>
       </ul>
      <ol class="solution-list">
        <li>
          It costs 38 trillion dollars to create oxygen for 6 months for all
          human beings on earth. "Trees do it for free"
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees properly placed around buildings can reduce
          air-conditioning needs by at least 30%.
        </li>
        <li>
          1 tree = 118 kg ozygen/year?<br>
          That would mean 1 million trees would produce: 118,000,000 kg of oxygen!<br>
          That is a whole lot of oxygen.
        </li>
       </ol>
